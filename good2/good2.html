    I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You hit me with a cricket
    bat. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What
    could possibly go wrong? I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt.
    *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. All I've got
    to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go
    wrong? The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad

    vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make
    them unimportant.

    Saving the world with meals on wheels. Saving the world with meals on
    wheels. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society
    Awful?'! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you
    every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. You hit me with a
    cricket bat. You've swallowed a planet! You know how I sometimes have
    really brilliant ideas? Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Aw, you're all
    Mr. Grumpy Face today.

    Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I am the last of my species, and I
    know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! All I've got to do
    is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?
    You hit me with a cricket bat. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot.
    Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.
    Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I am the last of my species, and I
    know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!
